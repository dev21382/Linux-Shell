The file 3 kern mod.c contains the code to create a module.Â The process task struct info function
in the module accesses the task struct of the process after retrieving it using the find vpid()
call and printing the details of the process in the kernel log.Once 3 kern mod.ko has been created
using makefile, it may be loaded using the insmod call and then used to view the message log using
the dmesg call.
