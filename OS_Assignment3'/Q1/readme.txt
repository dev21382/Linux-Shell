A ordering: Without the use of any scheduling primitives, the strict ordering method was used to implement the answer to the dining philospher problem. threads that stand in for philosophers. spoons equals to 1 indicate an occupied spoon, while spoons = 0 indicate an unoccupied spoon.

A Semaphore: The dining philospher problem's answer was implemented utilising the semaphore variable.array of threads that serve as symbols for philosophers. To symbolise spoons, a binary semaphore array of variables was employed.

B Ordering: The modified dining philospher problem's answer was implemented utilising the strict ordering method without the aid of any scheduling primitives.threads that stand in for philosophers. spoons equal to 1 indicate an occupied spoon, while spoons equal to 0 indicate an unoccupied spoon. The number of bowls available is represented by the bowl variable.

B Semaphore: used a semaphore variable to put the dining philospher problem's solution into practise. array of threads that serve as symbols for philosophers. To symbolise spoons, a binary semaphore array of variables was employed. Semaphore variable used to count the number of bowls that are available.
